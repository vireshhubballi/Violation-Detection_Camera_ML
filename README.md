# Violation Detection System using Camera and Machine Learning
A real-time system that detects violations using a webcam feed, a custom-trained image classification model, and YOLO object detection. Automatically stores detected images on AWS S3 and sends SMS alerts via Twilio.
Violation Detection System using Camera and Machine Learning



📋 Overview
This project implements an intelligent violation detection system leveraging real-time camera feeds and machine learning. Using a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection and a custom-trained image classifier, the system identifies potential violations and sends alerts with the captured images via SMS using the Twilio API. Detected images are securely stored on AWS S3 for future reference.

✨ Features
Real-time Detection: Leverages YOLO for detecting 'person' objects in a video stream.
Custom Image Classification: Uses a custom-trained TensorFlow model to classify detected events as violations or non-violations.
AWS S3 Integration: Automatically uploads detected violation images to an S3 bucket.
Twilio SMS Notifications: Sends SMS notifications with violation images to predefined phone numbers.
🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system along with pip (Python's package installer). You will also need an AWS account with S3 configured and a Twilio account for SMS services.

Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/violation-detection-system.git
cd violation-detection-system

Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or install them manually:
pip install tensorflow opencv-python boto3 twilio numpy

Download YOLO Files
Download the YOLO configuration and weights files:

yolov3.cfg
yolov3.weights
coco.names
Place these files in the root directory of your project.

Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your AWS and Twilio credentials:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number
RECIPIENT_PHONE_NUMBER=recipient_phone_number
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name

Place the Custom Model
Ensure that your custom-trained model imageclassifier.h5 is in the root directory of the project.

🚀 Usage
To start the violation detection system, simply run the main.py script:
python main.py

The system will start capturing video from your webcam.
When a person is detected, a screenshot is taken and classified.
If a violation is detected, the image is uploaded to AWS S3, and an SMS notification with the image is sent to the specified phone number.
Press q to stop the video feed and exit the program.

🧠 Model Training
The imageclassifier.h5 model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras on a custom dataset. The dataset was organized into two categories: violation and non-violation. Transfer learning techniques were employed to improve model accuracy, and the final model was fine-tuned with additional data.

If you wish to retrain or fine-tune the model:

Prepare your dataset with similar directory structure.
Modify the training script (train_model.py) to suit your needs.
Run the script and replace the old imageclassifier.h5 with the new model.

📡 AWS S3 and Twilio Setup
AWS S3
Make sure your S3 bucket is correctly configured with the necessary permissions to upload images.
Update the bucket name in the .env file.

Twilio
Sign up for a Twilio account if you don't have one.
Create a new Messaging Service and note down the SID and Auth Token.
Add your Twilio phone number and recipient phone number in the .env file.

📊 Monitoring and Logging
Logs for detected violations and SMS notifications are stored locally.
For enhanced monitoring, consider integrating with cloud-based logging solutions.
